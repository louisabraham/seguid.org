  abstract    = "In proteome studies, identification of proteins requires
                 searching protein sequence databases. The public protein
                 sequence databases (e.g., NCBInr, UniProt) each contain
                 millions of entries, and private databases add thousands more.
                 Although much of the sequence information in these databases
                 is redundant, each database uses distinct identifiers for the
                 identical protein sequence and often contains unique
                 annotation information. Users of one database obtain a
                 database-specific sequence identifier that is often difficult
                 to reconcile with the identifiers from a different database.
                 When multiple databases are used for searches or the databases
                 being searched are updated frequently, interpreting the
                 protein identifications and associated annotations can be
                 problematic. We have developed a database of unique protein
                 sequence identifiers called Sequence Globally Unique
                 Identifiers (SEGUID) derived from primary protein sequences.
                 These identifiers serve as a common link between multiple
                 sequence databases and are resilient to annotation changes in
                 either public or private databases throughout the lifetime of
                 a given protein sequence. The SEGUID Database can be
                 downloaded (http://bioinformatics.anl.gov/SEGUID/) or easily
                 generated at any site with access to primary protein sequence
                 databases. Since SEGUIDs are stable, predictions based on the
                 primary sequence information (e.g., pI, Mr) can be calculated
                 just once; we have generated approximately 500 different
                 calculations for more than 2.5 million sequences. SEGUIDs are
                 used to integrate MS and 2-DE data with bioinformatics
                 information and provide the opportunity to search multiple
                 protein sequence databases, thereby providing a higher
                 probability of finding the most valid protein identifications.",

  abstract     = "Background: Synthetic biology involves combining different DNA fragments, each containing functional biological parts, to address specific problems. Fundamental gene-function research often requires cloning and propagating DNA fragments, such as those from the iGEM Parts Registry or Addgene, typically distributed as circular plasmids. Addgene{\textquoteright}s repository alone offers over 100,000 plasmids. To ensure data integrity, cryptographic checksums can be calculated for the sequences. Each sequence has a unique checksum, making checksums useful for validation and quick lookups of associated annotations. For example, the SEGUID checksum, uniquely identifies protein sequences with a 27-character string. Objectives: The original SEGUID, while effective for protein sequences and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is not suitable for circular and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) due to topological differences. Challenges include how to uniquely represent linear dsDNA, circular ssDNA, and circular dsDNA. To meet these needs, we propose SEGUID v2, which extends the original SEGUID to handle additional types of sequences. Conclusions: SEGUID v2 produces strand and rotation invariant checksums for single-stranded, double-stranded, possibly staggered, linear, and circular DNA and RNA sequences. Customizable alphabets allows for other types of sequences. In contrast to the original SEGUID, which uses Base64, SEGUID v2 uses Base64url to encode the SHA-1 hash. This ensures SEGUID v2 checksums can be used as-is in filenames, regardless of platform, and in URLs, with minimal friction. Availability: SEGUID v2 is readily available for major programming languages distributed under the MIT license.
