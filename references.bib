  abstract    = "In proteome studies, identification of proteins requires
                 searching protein sequence databases. The public protein
                 sequence databases (e.g., NCBInr, UniProt) each contain
                 millions of entries, and private databases add thousands more.
                 Although much of the sequence information in these databases
                 is redundant, each database uses distinct identifiers for the
                 identical protein sequence and often contains unique
                 annotation information. Users of one database obtain a
                 database-specific sequence identifier that is often difficult
                 to reconcile with the identifiers from a different database.
                 When multiple databases are used for searches or the databases
                 being searched are updated frequently, interpreting the
                 protein identifications and associated annotations can be
                 problematic. We have developed a database of unique protein
                 sequence identifiers called Sequence Globally Unique
                 Identifiers (SEGUID) derived from primary protein sequences.
                 These identifiers serve as a common link between multiple
                 sequence databases and are resilient to annotation changes in
                 either public or private databases throughout the lifetime of
                 a given protein sequence. The SEGUID Database can be
                 downloaded (http://bioinformatics.anl.gov/SEGUID/) or easily
                 generated at any site with access to primary protein sequence
                 databases. Since SEGUIDs are stable, predictions based on the
                 primary sequence information (e.g., pI, Mr) can be calculated
                 just once; we have generated approximately 500 different
                 calculations for more than 2.5 million sequences. SEGUIDs are
                 used to integrate MS and 2-DE data with bioinformatics
                 information and provide the opportunity to search multiple
                 protein sequence databases, thereby providing a higher
                 probability of finding the most valid protein identifications.",
