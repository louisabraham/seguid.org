It is critical that any SEGUID checksums generated are correct.  We
have composed a set of unit tests that validate the correctness of any
implementation.  All SEGUID v2 implementations have to pass these
tests before being released.  We rely on continuous integration (CI)
tests on GitHub Actions to check every modification to the different
codebases.  Any future implementation in another programming language
has to undergo the same strict testing.
