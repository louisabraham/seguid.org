_WARNING: We need to figure out how to install
**seguid** here. This is based on the Quarto extension
<https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/pyodide/>._
:::

This is an online demo of the Python package **[seguid]** and the SEGUID v2
algorithm.  The below examples run an Python instance completely within
your web browser based on [Pyodide] and [WebAssembly].

To run the examples, click 'Run Code'. Feel free to edit any of them
as you prefer. Nothing you type or enter below leaves your web
browser.  See **[seguid]** for the details on these functions,
including what type of arguments they take.
